# React Timer Challenge

I am going to give him the React Timer challenge one because that was really tricky for me to do.

**Stage Zero Instructions**
[Go to](https://orange-happiness-9746565v6x63pwxp.github.dev/)
Run
```bash
npm i; npm run dev;
```

**Criteria of Performance**
1. Clear communication about why you are doing what you are doing
2. Focused and effective debugging
3. Good variable naming conventions
4. Good component architecture principles

**Stage One**
Create a Timer in react that will display a countdown from n milliseconds. It should have one prop:
1. The time, in milliseconds, that the component is counting down from.

**Stage Two**
1. Add a button that, when pressed, starts the countdown over again (reset)

**Stage Three**
1. Add a pause button that, when pressed, toggles the state of counter between counting and not counting

**Stage Four**
1. Move the pause and reset buttons outside the timer component and into their own component, *or* components
